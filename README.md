# Musician Practice Drones

Musician Practice Drones is a tool for instrumentalists and vocalists to improve intonation, ear-training and improvisation skills.

- The app offers the ability to play drones based on all 12 notes of the major scale.
- A unique feature compared to other drone apps is that you can build your own chords/soundscapes by selecting multiple notes at once.

The app in it's current version is fully deployed at: <a href="http://www.musicianpracticedrones.com">www.musicianpracticedrones.com</a>

\*\* This is an ongoing project. I am currently working on more features including improving the audio looping and sound quality.

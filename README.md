# Musician Practice Drones

Musician Practice Drones is a tool for instrumentalists and vocalists to improve intonation, ear-training and improvisation skills.

- The app offers the ability to play drones based on all 12 notes of the major scale.
- A unique feature compared to other drone apps is that you can build your own chords/soundscapes by selecting multiple notes at once.
